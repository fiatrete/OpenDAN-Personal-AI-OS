# OpenDAN: Personal AI Server OS
OpenDAN is an open source Personal AI Server OS, which ensures that everyone has the ability to use AI safely, freely, and equally.

## **Project Introduction**

The goal of OpenDAN (Open and Do Anything Now with AI) is to create a Personal AI Server OS. With OpenDAN, users can effectively manage their private data in the personal domain and create secure, free, and personalized private AI applications using this data.

This project is still in its very early stages, and there may be significant changes in the future.

## **Core Features of OpenDAN**

To achieve the goal of OpenDAN, we provide the following key features:

1. **Hardware-specific optimization**: Optimize for specific hardware to enable smooth local running of most open-source AI applications.
2. **Open AI App Marketplace**: Offer a solution for one-click installation and use of various AI applications, helping users easily access and manage AI apps.
3. **Open AI Model Solution**: Provide a unified entry point for model search, download, and access control, making it convenient for users to find and use models suitable for their needs.
4. **Strict Privacy Protection and Management**: Strictly manage personal data, ranging from family albums to chat records and social media records, and provide a unified access control interface for AI applications.
5. **Integrated Tools**: Offer tools for users to train their own voice models, Lora models, knowledge models, etc., using personal data.
6. **AI Butler Assistant**: Driven by a large language model, the AI assistant completes tasks through natural language interaction.
7. **Development Framework**: Provide a development framework for customizing AI assistants for specific purposes, making it easy for developers to create unique AI applications for users.
